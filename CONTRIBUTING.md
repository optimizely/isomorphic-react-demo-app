#Contributing to the Optimizely JavaScript SDK

We welcome contributions and feedback! All contributors must sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://docs.google.com/a/optimizely.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9cbouWptIpMgukAKZZOIAhafvjFCV8hS00XJLWQnWDFtwtA/viewform) to be eligible to contribute. Please read the [README](README.md) to set up your development environment, then read the guidelines below for information on submitting your code.

## Development process

1. Create a branch off of `master`: `git checkout -b YOUR_NAME/branch_name`.
2. Commit your changes.
3. `git push` your changes to GitHub.
4. Open a pull request from `YOUR_NAME/branch_name` to `master`.
5. A repository maintainer will review your pull request and, if all goes well, merge it!
